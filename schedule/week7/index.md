- Begin working on proposals for typeface website

## FOR THURSDAY
Create two unique proposals (using InDesign, Illustrator, Sketch, etc.) for the website your typeface will live on. Each proposal should include at least three sections: specimen, showcase, hoverstate. We should be able to visualize your website proposal by looking at these three pages. How can your website's focus not only reinforce but push forward the concept of your typeface? Remember to upload the sketches to your class website.
