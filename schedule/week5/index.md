# Week 5

## TUESDAY

- Project 1 Final Crit

_Critique Format_  
For today's critique, we will spend ~10 minutes on each person. For the first ~5 minutes, everyone but the designer can talk. The classmate to your right will explore your project, projected for the entire class to see. During this time, we should try to have a conversation about the work, or at least describe it. Then, in the last ~5 minutes, the designer can respond to the conversation we just had.

## FOR THURSDAY
- Complete Part 1 of exercise: [Spreadsheet Typeface](https://docs.google.com/a/cca.edu/document/d/1YAJbh5283h2jdKpK9crq92muggGNCDDTe7lL4Ngid6s/edit?usp=sharing)
- JiaYue prepare your presentation on Bitcoin & Digital Currency
- Megan prepare your presentation on Edward Snowden

## THURSDAY
- Deploy [Project 2](/projects/project-2/)
- JiaYue presents Bitcoin, Megan presents Edward Snowden
- look at some examples of type on the web
- in small groups, determine which letters create the foundation for the majority of the characters of the alphabet. What are they for lower case—and upper case?

## FOR NEXT WEEK
- Create 3 discussion questions for the reading and post them in the [Week 6 Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/a/cca.edu/document/d/1CboWmh4cyhJkN5WS9wKZk5jT5uyWR_Ls_Sr0WzSwPfI/edit?usp=sharing)
- Read [Computed Type](http://fall2017.designing.tools/content/6-library/16-computed-type/computed-type_christophknoth.pdf) — and check out [the video](https://vimeo.com/60651938)
- For P2, create three unique directions for your typeface. Begin by sketching the fundamental letters we discovered in small group. Conceptually and formally, each direction should be uniquely different from each other – make sure you define the following qualities for each: width, contrast amount, weight, stroke endings, construction (lowercase or uppercase). If you're stuck, use the [Typecooker](http://http://typecooker.com/) for inspiration.
While sketching, consider how each typeface would exist as code and in the browser space. (Do this in InDesign or Illustrator and create a PDF to discuss on Monday.) Design with each typeface with a purpose in mind and be prepared to explain these concepts on Monday.


## REMINDER

- _Gabby_ , please prepare your presentation on _Grace Hopper_
