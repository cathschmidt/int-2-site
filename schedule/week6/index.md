- While students are working on the exercise, Catherine & Clement will have one-on-one discussions for your three typeface directions

ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

.?!,”“ (punctuation)  

## THURSDAY
- Gabby present on Grace Hopper
- Pin-up your alphabets to discuss

## FOR NEXT WEEK
Translate at least 4 of your letters into code. Begin thinking about how your letterforms may be best showcased as a website.
