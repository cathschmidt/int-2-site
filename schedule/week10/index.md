## TUESDAY

- Final crit P2 with guest critic TBD

_Critique Format_  
For today's critique, we will spend ~10 minutes on each person. For the first ~5 minutes, everyone but the designer can talk. The classmate to your right will explore your project, projected for the entire class to see. During this time, we should try to have a conversation about the work, or at least describe it. Then, in the last ~5 minutes, the designer can respond to the conversation we just had.
